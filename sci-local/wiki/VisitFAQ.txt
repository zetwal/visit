=== Running ===

(from terminal)[[br]]
'''cd /path/to/visit/installation'''[[br]]
'''./bin/visit'''[[br]]
[[br]]
(parallel client)[[br]]
'''./bin/visit -np 4''' (np stands for number of processes)[[br]]

[=#ParallelReqs]
=== Parallel OSX Client Requirements ===
Running in parallel for things like faster streamlines (please note this will not make SLIVR volume rendering any faster).[[br]]
[[BR]]
You will need to install OpenMPI and create a symbolic link from the install location to /usr/local/mpi.[[BR]]
Briefly, this is how to install it (if it's already installed, just create the symlink at the end):[[BR]]
First, download the source from [http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.6/ the OpenMPI site].
{{{
 cd /path/to/openmpi-download
 mkdir build
 cd build
 ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/openmpi-1.6.4
 make -j8
 sudo make install
 cd /usr/local
 sudo ln -s /usr/local/openmpi-1.6.4 mpi
}}}

=== Rendering ===

==== Local ====
We recommend using the SLIVR volume renderer for fast, high quality volume rendering of local datasets. More information can be found [http://uintah.sci.utah.edu/VisIt/VisIt/Release_Notes/Entries/2013/4/4_Blue_bird_day.html here][[BR]]

[=#SLIVR_Raycasting]
==== Remote ====
When loading and rendering datasets from remote systems such as ember, updraft or aurora, we recommend using '''SLIVR Raycasting''', which uses far less bandwidth with comparable quality.[[br]]
[[BR]]
To select this renderer, add a Volume and double click the new item to open the rendering preferences. Select '''SLIVR Raycasting''' from the dropdown menu.[[BR]]
[[BR]]
Hints:
 * Acquiring more nodes and making your window smaller will speed up rendering times.

=== Issues ===

These are some known issues our users have encountered:
 * switching from Raycasting to SLIVR renderer will cause the rendering engine to crash. This is a known issue with !VisIt 2.6.2 and we are working with the !VisIt developers to resolve it.
 * parallel Raycasting does not work from the local client. This is a known issue with !VisIt 2.6.2 and we are working with the !VisIt developers to resolve it.
 * for staggered data, gzip compression in uintah must be disabled or the resulting uda files will be corrupt (for !VisIt, SCIRun or anything else).
 * !VisIt contains a number of memory leaks (~32K as reported by valgrind), most of which shouldn't prevent normal operation, but be aware you might have to restart it periodically to reclaim memory.
 * the version of !VisIt installed on '''ember''' and '''updraft''' requires the mvapich2 version of `mpirun` to be in the path '''(OpenMP will not work)'''.[[br]]
For example, you might have this in your .bashrc:[[BR]]
{{{
 # Do Updraft specific initializations
    if [[ "$UUFSCELL" = "updraft.arches" ]] ; then
      source /uufs/updraft.arches/sys/pkg/mvapich2/1.7/etc/mvapich2.sh
 # Do Ember specific initializations
    elif [[ "$UUFSCELL" = "ember.arches" ]] ; then
      source /uufs/ember.arches/sys/pkg/mvapich2/1.7/etc/mvapich2.sh
}}}
 * there is a small unresolved problem with some AMR sub-meshes, but most should render correctly. This is a known issue with !VisIt 2.6.2 and we are working with the !VisIt developers to resolve it.
